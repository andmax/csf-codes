Goal:

The goal of this project is to host the source codes for the "Computer
Science Fundamentals" course at the State University of Rio de
Janeiro.

Note:

The csf-codes repository is based on the Princeton textbook:
Introduction to Programming in Java; copyright by Robert Sedgewick and
Kevin Wayne.  The codes from this textbook were translated to a
simple-to-learn language, Pascal, and several other codes were added.
The Makefile and codes were written using Ubuntu Linux distribution
and GPC (Gnu Pascal Compiler).
